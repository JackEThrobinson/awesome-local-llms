# üëã Awesome Local LLMs

There are an overwhelming number of open-source tools for local LLM inference - for both proprietary and open weights LLMs. These tools generally lie within three categories:

1. LLM inference backend engine
2. LLM front end UI
3. All-in-one desktop application

However these tools can overlap in scope with new features are constantly being added so I have chosen not to manually categorize or label features of each project.

GitHub repository metrics, like number of stars, contributors, issues, releases, and time since last commit, have been collected as a proxy for popularity and active maintenance.

**Contributions are welcome!** Feel free to suggest open-source repos that I have missed either in the Issues of this repo or run the script in the [script](https://github.com/vince-lam/awesome-local-llms/tree/script) branch and update the README and make a pull request.

For full table with all metrics go to this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xv38p90V3GiJXjq0a3qc24056Vicn1I5MG6QiFE6nVE/edit?usp=sharing).
